## Title
HyperPhS: A pharmacophore-guided multi-view representation for metabolic stability prediction through contrastively hypergraph learning

## Abstract
Metabolic stability is crucial in the early stages of drug discovery and development. Pharmacophores, the functional groups within drug molecules, directly bind to receptors or biological macromolecules to produce biological effects, thereby significantly influencing metabolic stability. Accurately predicting this stability can streamline drug candidate screening and optimize lead compounds. Given the high costs of wet lab experiments, in silico prediction offers a valuable yet underdeveloped alternative. Furthermore, determining metabolic stability using a pharmacophore-guided approach remains a significant challenge.

To address these issues, we develop a novel pharmacophore-guided hypergraph-based approach for metabolic stability prediction named HyperPhS.
